        <span> By John Nasimba</span>
       <p>I conducted my research online to see which are the best courses under $50 per month.
        Among the list are courses from <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lynda.com</a>( A learning institute owned by LinkedIn),
         <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/browse/javascript?via=browse-related-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skillshare</a> ,
        and <a href="https://alison.com/courses/front-end-languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> <a href="https://alison.com/courses/front-end-languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alison.com</a>. 
        However, Courses  from these sites will not listed because they have one to two-month free membership trial
        which I can capitalize on before buying the course. If I can first lake some courses from Udemy or Coursera 
        it may mean that with the prerequisite knowledge I may be able to complete a course from Lynda.com or Skillshare in less than a month making it free of charge.  
        Allison.con offers most of its courses for free but to get the qualification one has to pay and the payment varies depending on the course taken.</p> <br>
        <p>
       Listed below are the top courses from Udemy and Coursera. Let me apologize first for not citing references. This is because I am in the middle
        of another project and I am trying my level best to buy some time to finish the first project.

        <h5>HONOURABLE MENTIONS</h5>
        <p>For the past 5 months, I have been learning to code from Codecademy,  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp</a>, Youtube, 
         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla developers</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> W3Schools</a>. The only platform I was paying for is Codecademy.
         I have been failing to pay for the last month to finish my course due to the current financial crisis. I am 95 percent done with the course even though it is splaying that
         I am 76% done on the web development path. This Is so because I reset some of the courses to start again to have a solid understanding. In addition to that, I did not
         take some courses such as learning tech-stack frameworks. If I can be able to pay for one more month am sure I will finish the web development course and have my full certificate.
         Right now I only have these <a href="./Nasimba.pdf" type="application/pdf" target="blank">Short Certificates like this one</a>

      . You can see my profile on Codecademy
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/login" target="_blank" rel="no opener no-referrer">HERE</a>. I will send login credentials on Whatsapp together with the link to this page.
